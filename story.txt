I had a dream once. (0:00)      --allow player input (c)
It was a wonderful dream, about many many things. (0:04)
It was a void. (0:09)        --add a slight texture to the void (c)
A dark, dark void. (0:18)
It was silent, except for a single underlying pattern. (0:45)
Getting prettier (0:56)                   --add spark animation? (c)
With every spark. (1:02)
Poetry created by this song (1:13)
Conducted by the player in a wonderful way (1:20)       --add movement? (c)
Like a beatiful haiku (1:29)
About sakura blossom (1:37)
Which fell at 5cm per second (1:45)
Within this void (1:52)
Majesty was created (2:00)
Like the Disasterpeace track (2:07)
in the key of A minor (2:10)
then major (2:13)
then every key (2:17)
conducted with sparks (2:25)
in a continuous pattern (2:30)
to make a pretty tune (2:37)
a song of sparks (2:44)
in your pretty void (2:50)
instruments are added (2:54)
and as you go (3:00)         --void lightens(c)
the void lights up (3:02)    --lightens more
and you exit your pretty little void (3:13)
into your pretty little world (3:27)    --grass and stuff
