imagine void
pure void, no notes escape
as it continues, silence breaks in a point
as you enter.

beads of hope crystalise at touch
and dot around, patterns created, endlessly looping
for their lifespan
for each thing in pairs of sparks erupts a melody
so quiet that only ghosts of the void listen and repeat
a harmony develops, creating beauty in this madness
that is a void.

how could we have gone silent for so long?
calls choirs of spirits, eminating sparks like no tomorrow
in their beauty harmonising perfect chords
as if they'd been practising their whole lives.
who knew that they'd been born pitch perfect,
creating patterns not capable of even the greatest composers
as they sang their hearts out
despite lacking body parts

the ghosts knew of their inevitable fate, that
in time they'd waste all their sparks,
or rather, utilised them to perfect degree
as they'd done their job
been satisfied, created hope in that dark void.

how could they better this experience
create new cadences, new patterns in this void without
fear of fading away?
the ghosts did not know how to deal with this predicament
so just poured more heart and soul into their hollow songs
filled out by a single figure's conducting
a player by your name

the ghosts could fall happy
as members of their orchestra
so morosely went away, one by one, till only the quietest tunes remained
that single figure hummed harmonies as few ghosts remained
attempting to fill out their hollow songs
but their barbershop quartet wasn't enough

dead friends did not stop the remaining ones
as more rose to the challenge and created wonderful patterns
new harmonies present over multitudes of intervals
entire octaves surpassed by a group of spirits
and their friends, together, opening a new light in the story
in the void.

for the void was no more, as pairs of ghosts created wonder inside a lifeless cavern
	and new life was created.
the end
