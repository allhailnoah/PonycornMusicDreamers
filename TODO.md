# Ideas
*Voice acting by Finnbar!
*Lighting actual sparks when game starts, to light up the void.
*More events that change what happens, like the sparks changing color, suddenly having gravity or orbiting each other.
*Music that comes in looping segments so we can make them go as long as we want until the player completes some task.
*Sparks that glow a little with multiply blending.
*Different shapes of Sparks.
*Camera Wobble at different parts.
*Chakra-based story? Something about facing yourself.
*Sandbox mode in different gamestate.
*Better finnticle system.
*Trombonist's Dream as a NewGame+? Nah. Maybe looping in sandbox mode somehow?
*Song recording. Complicated.
