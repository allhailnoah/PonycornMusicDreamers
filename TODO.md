# WHERE TO GO NEXT:

* Well, I know you wanted to add a background track, Finnbar. You'd better get to that. The game can quit after 5 minutes, so that's all that we need. Arpeggio. =)
* Add some sort of minimal story? Navi could do the trick. Just have little messages come up through the five minute experience, talking about- how the narrator had a dream once? Make sure to disable messagebox windows if you'd want to do this. Perhaps he could ask questions at certain points that affect the background track?
* If we have time, maybe we can try to figure out a way to record the song and give the player a file of it? I know it'd be complicated with where we are now, but it would add something.

Lesser ideas:
* Different particles with different sounds, spawned with different buttons.
* Networking, but I really have trouble seeing how that would work.
