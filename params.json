We also make this game for MiniLD, which has two themes, Music and Dreams. We call ourselves Rebel Team All Hail Noah, where Noah means @iandioch. Yup.\r\n\r\n## Engine\r\n\r\nThis game was done with Love2D framework.\r\n\r\n### Libraries used:\r\n\r\n* Advanced Tiled Loader by Kadoba- Used to load from the Tiled editor, has its own repo here: https://github.com/Kadoba/Advanced-Tiled-Loader\r\n* Navi by litearc- A RPG-style library for text boxes: https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=9265&sid=209959bbc46253d8948a7f5fb55f6b08\r\n* Quickie by vrld- A immediate mode GUI lib, its repo here: https://github.com/vrld/Quickie\r\n* Bump, tween, anim8, middleclass, and gamera by kikito- They do a lot of things. Check his github here: https://github.com/kikito\r\n* Tserial by Taehl- Used for creating save files. https://love2d.org/wiki/Tserial\r\n\r\nThanks to Inny, thelinx, YellowAfterLife and bartbes for ideas for some of Puzzlem00n's code.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nThis is not ready. @Puzzlem00n likes elevator music, and we wanted to put some in here, but as long as we don't have elevator music we recommend Big Giant Circles' BGC418 (feat. C418), which is a masterpiece and totally not an elevator music. Anyway go to [BGC's BandCamp](http://music.biggiantcircles.com/track/bgc418-feat-c418) or [Spotify] (http://open.spotify.com/track/0fnIV0ImkcxLyNPF9OtbO4) to listen to it while we try to get this game done. We recommend you to buy it, and the whole Impostor Nostalgia album, as it supports a great indie musician. You can also head to [Puzzle's Twitch] (http://twitch.tv/Puzzlem00n).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
